CMPT 318  Data Analysis Project

Description:
This project was developed for the class cmpt 318 data analytics which was taken at the University of Saskatchewan in 2023 during the fall semester.
The project uses a data set that was sourced from kaggle, which can be found using the following link: 
The goal for this project was to analyse a data set of user video games from steam and construct a model to determine if user recommendations can be predicted based on genre tags.

The report folder contains detailed information on each step of the project including the methods I used to analyse and clean the data.

The model was not able to accurately predict user recommendations based on genre tags. A lack of data and data diversity may have contributed to this outcome.
More details on the projects outcome can be found in the results.pdf file inside the 'Report' folder.
